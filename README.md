# Stytch M2M authentication example in Node.js
## Overview
This example application demonstrates how one may use Stytch's suite of M2M authentication endpoints within a Node.js application. 

The application features two backend services in a hypothetical fintech neobank: the Payment Management Service and the Wallet Management Service. The Payment Service, which is responsible for processing outward debits from a PayPal customer's wallet, securely communicates with the Wallet Service to access a customer‚Äôs current ‚ÄúwalletBalance‚Äù.

The Payment Service requires the customer's current wallet balance to determine whether they have sufficient funds to successfully process a pending outward debit of $769 from their PayPal wallet. Throughout the code, we occasionally refer to the Payment Service as ‚Äúpayment-server‚Äù and the Wallet Service as ‚Äúwallet-server‚Äù.

The application utilizes Stytch‚Äôs M2M endpoints to create M2M applications, request and authenticate JWT access tokens, define permission scopes, rotate client secrets, and update M2M clients. This project also utilizes [Stytch's Node Backend SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stytch) to validate all issued JWT access tokens.

The example application has two directories: a payment-server that‚Äôs responsible for processing outgoing debits from a PayPal customer's wallet, and a wallet-server that holds the protected resource that the payment-server needs secure access to (‚ÄúwalletInfo‚Äù).
### Two main directories
- Payment-server (holds the stytch.js implementation and the server.js file for initiating payment).
* Wallet-server (holds the middleware directory that contains the authorizeToken.js implementation and the server.js file that contains the customer‚Äôs wallet balance).

The payment-server directory contains a helper directory that holds the stytch.js file with our Stytch implementation, except for authorizing access tokens. The payment-server also utilizes `node-cache` in the `stytch.js` helper functions to persist and access our access tokens. In addition, the payment-server houses a server.js file, which serves as the directory's entry point, mounts the "/initiate-payment" route to process outward payments and handles M2M client creation via stytch.js.

On the other hand, the wallet-server directory holds a middleware directory that contains an authorizeToken.js file. This file authorizes access tokens with the necessary scopes before granting access to the protected resource. The wallet-server also contains a server.js file which holds the protected resource (‚ÄúwalletInfo‚Äù) and mounts the ‚Äú/api/check-balance‚Äù route to return the requested customer‚Äôs wallet details, specifically their ‚ÄúwalletId‚Äù and ‚ÄúwalletBalance‚Äù.
## Set up
If you want to run the example application on your machine, make sure you follow the steps below.
### In your Stytch Dashboard
[Sign up](https://stytch.com/start-now) to get a Stytch developer account if you don‚Äôt have one. Then, [log in to your Stytch account](https://stytch.com/start-now) and create a Consumer Authentication project if you don‚Äôt have one already.

Now that your account is set up, go to the [Dashboard](https://stytch.com/dashboard/home) and click API Keys under the Configuration section of the sidenav. We‚Äôll be using your Stytch Project‚Äôs Test environment, so copy your Project‚Äôs credentials: the ‚Äúproject_id‚Äù and ‚Äúsecret‚Äù.

### On your machine
To begin, you have to clone the example application. Run the following command in the terminal to clone it. The example app is an Express app.

```
git clone https://github.com/StytchExamples/stytch-m2m-node-example/
```

Next, navigate to the root of both the payment-server and wallet-server directories and run the following commands to install the dependencies for each directory:

```
// In the payment-server directory
cd payment-server
npm install

// In the wallet-server directory
cd wallet-server
npm install
```
In the root of both the payment-server and wallet-server directories, create a .env file and populate the fields with your Project‚Äôs credentials that you copied, using the following key/value format:

```
//.env file for the (payment-server)
PORT=6000
STYTCH_PROJECT_ID = 'Provide Your Stytch Project Id'
STYTCH_SECRET = 'Provide Your Stytch Project Secret'
CLIENT_ID = 'Provide Your M2M Client Id'
CLIENT_SECRET = 'Provide Your M2M Client Secret'

//.env file for the (wallet-server)
PORT=4000
STYTCH_PROJECT_ID='Provide Your Stytch Project ID'
STYTCH_SECRET='Provide Your Stytch Project Secret'
```
### Running the example app locally
After completing all the previous steps, you can run each of the servers with the following command:

```
// Run the payment-server
npm start

// Run the wallet-server
npm start
```

The payment-server (Payment Service) will be available at http://localhost:6000, and the wallet-server (Wallet Service) will be available at http://localhost:4000 when you run them locally on your machine.
